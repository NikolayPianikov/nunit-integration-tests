Feature: NUnit release OS resources

Background:
	Given NUnit path is ..\nunit\
	
Scenario Outline: Agent is finished when AppDomain did not unloaded correctly
	Given Framework version is <frameworkVersion>	
	And I have added UnloadingDomain method as UnloadingDomain to the class Foo.Tests.UnitTests1 for foo.tests
	And I have created the folder mocks
	And I have added NUnit framework references to foo.tests
	And I have copied NUnit framework references to folder mocks
	And I have specified <platform> platform for assembly foo.tests
	And I have compiled the assembly foo.tests to file mocks\foo.tests.dll	
	And I have added the assembly mocks\foo.tests.dll to the list of testing assemblies
	When I run NUnit console
	Then processes nunit-agent are finished
	Then processes nunit-agent-x86 are finished
			
Examples:
	| frameworkVersion | platform |
	| Version45         | AnyCpu   |
	| Version40         | AnyCpu   |
	| Version45         | X86      |
	| Version40         | X86      |
